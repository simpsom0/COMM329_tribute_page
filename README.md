# Tribute Page

## The Scenario
You’ve taken on a client who’s asked you to create a
single webpage as a tribute to a particular topic. The
client needs a working prototype of the page
completed in three weeks. **Using the provided
wireframe, develop a tribute page on a topic of
your choice that is both useful and attractive in
all major browsers, at all screen sizes.**

*You may choose any topic for your tribute page, but
compelling content makes for a compelling design, so
try to choose something engaging and be sure to select
the best images and content you can find. If you use
other people’s content, credit and link your sources.*

## Procedure
This section outlines the main stages of the project,
presented in order. Try to gauge how long each will
take you to aid in your planning.

Start by researching a topic and acquiring the
necessary assets: colors, fonts, images, and text.

Next, draft the page copy, including microcopy.

Then, code the basic outer HTML page structure.

Then write the styles for the page layout (i.e. grid,
flex, margins/padding, and typography).

After that, code the inner HTML and content.

Finally, style the colors and the interactive effects.

When you’re finished, test your page in all major
browsers (Chrome, FireFox and Safari) at a variety of
screen sizes.
